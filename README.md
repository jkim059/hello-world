# hello-world
Trying out Github for the first time

I am an aspiring programmer/developer and I am really excited to experience new kinds of work and opportunties. I find myself to be passionate when it comes to any field of technology and I am always curious as to find out new terminology that I am not familiar with to the point that I become familiarized with it. Also, youtube channels like Jomatech and Jarvis Johnson have really inspired to take myself on this precarious path that is full of suprises.
